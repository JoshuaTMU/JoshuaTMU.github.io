<h1>Lab 10 Assignment</h1>
<p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and involves techniques to optimize your website to improve its visibility so it is more likely to appear when a user searches on the web (Duggal, 2024). The first SEO technique I found to be useful and perfect for a portfolio website are Metadata SEO optimizations. This technique is where you change your meta descriptions, title, and header tags with suitable words and phrases (Duggal, 2024). A website’s meta description is part of the search engine results page and is related to what the user has searched for (Ellis, 2024).</p>
<p>Metadata SEO optimizations improve the website's visibility. As you are giving the user and search engine an idea of what your website is, using the words/phrases you have put in the meta description, title, and header tags (Duggal, 2024). Meta Descriptions can be as long as you want, but is recommended for it to be 7 words to 26 words (Ellis, 2024). This is because most search engines shorten the meta description to fit the user’s device search engine results page layout (Ellis, 2024).</p>
<p>The second SEO technique I found potential useful in the future is creating a Google Business Profile. A Google Business Profile is a profile that is listed on Google and can include items such as your name, website, operating hours, description, photos, and many more (Berry, 2024).</p>
<p>Google Business Profiles are useful because it allows you to make your website more visible as you can interact with users reviews, and the information on your profile gives Google and the user an idea of what services you provide (Berry, 2024).</p>
<p>Lastly, the third SEO technique I found useful for a portfolio website is providing links to other sites. Having internal and external links on your website is one of Google’s core ranking factors when ranking in search results (Berry, 2024). When putting safe and reliable links on your website, you are showing search engines that your website is trustworthy and helpful (Berry, 2024).</p>
<p>Another SEO technique that is related to this are Backlinks. Backlinks are when other websites put links on their page that leads back to your website (Storm, 2024). It shows the search engine that your website is relevant and provides the user with a recommendation to your website, boosting your search engine optimization (Storm, 2024).</p>

<h2>Technique Chosen</h2>
<p>The SEO technique I chose was Metadata SEO optimizations and putting external links on my website. For my meta descriptions I put "Joshua Chung's portfolio website, work experience, education, and extracurricular activities" and for keywords I put "Portfolio website, school, assignment, lab, LinkedIn". I also included external links that link to my program, school, Toronto Metropolitan University’s Instagram, my LinkedIn, and school Bootcamp badges.</p>

<h4>Overview:</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Joshua! I am currently a student at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), majoring in Business Technology Management.</p>

<p>In the Business Technology Management Program, Students study many aspects of business such as marketing, accounting, finance, and information technology.
    So far, I learned how to analyze businesses needs to leverage and create effective technological solutions. 
    Students use these skills to improve business processes and create opportunities.</p>

<p>The course I found most useful was Introduction to Professional Communication (CMN279).
    In this course, I learned how to communicate more effectively with others through case studies and simulations. This was especially helpful during my Co-op roles at XYZ Storage and Softchoice as I communicated with my teams on a daily basis. 
    This has allowed me to complete my work projects on time and effectively coordinate staff events.</p>
