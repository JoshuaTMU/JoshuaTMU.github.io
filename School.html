<h4>Overview:</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Joshua! I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU)</a>, majoring in <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/programs/undergraduate/business-technology-management/" target="_blank">Business Technology Management</a>.</p>

<p>In the Business Technology Management Program, Students study many aspects of business such as marketing, accounting, finance, and information technology.
    So far, I learned how to analyze businesses needs to leverage and create effective technological solutions. 
    Students use these skills to improve business processes and create opportunities.</p>

<p>The course I found most useful was Introduction to Professional Communication (CMN279).
    In this course, I learned how to communicate more effectively with others through case studies and simulations. This was especially helpful during my Co-op roles at XYZ Storage and Softchoice as I communicated with my teams on a daily basis. 
    This has allowed me to complete my work projects on time and effectively coordinate staff events.</p>
